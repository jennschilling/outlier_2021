00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
I'm Jenn Schilling, and today I'm going to talk 
about how to set the focus order on a Tableau  

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,040
dashboard. When I made the COVID-19 dashboard 
for the University of Arizona, where I work as  

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,400
a senior data analyst, the focus order became an 
issue immediately after the dashboard went live.  

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm going to share why focus order 
matters, how it can be set within Tableau,  

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,680
and the implications to data visualization as a 
whole. Before we get started, let's define focus  

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,240
order. Focus order is the order in which a user 
accesses elements of a web page or a dashboard.  

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,160
And normally we would want a user or viewer of our 
dashboards to access them in a sequential order  

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,760
top to bottom, left to right. In Tableau, 
though, when we add elements to a dashboard  

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,880
the focus order is automatically set for us, and 
it's set by the order in which elements are added. 

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,080
So, as we're building the dashboard each time we 
add a new sheet or a new element to the dashboard  

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,560
that element gets an ID and that ID determines 
the focus order. Normally as we're building  

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,800
and designing dashboards we're not necessarily 
thinking about the top to bottom, left to right  

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
sequence or final order of the layout of the 
dashboard, so this becomes an issue when those  

14
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,640
IDs are automatically set for us. And i'm going 
to show you an example here where the red arrow  

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,240
is going to show the focus order and reading 
through this screenshot of part of the dashboard.  

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,640
So it starts with the title but then it goes down 
to the past 10 days and then it goes back up to  

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,720
the date when data was last pulled, it goes down 
to the graph and back up to the most recent day. 

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,200
So as you saw that's not the logical top to 
bottom, left to right order, but we can fix this.

19
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,040
Underneath a Tableau workbook is an XML file, and 
so if the workbook is saved as a .tbw you can open  

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,560
that file in a text editor and edit the XML. Each 
element on a dashboard is contained within a zone  

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,720
element in the XML, and each of these zone elements 
has an ID attribute. By setting the ID attributes,  

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:13,200
we set the focus order. So what we can do is go 
back through our dashboard, and in each element  

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,600
we can set the focus order to be a logical number 
or order from that top to bottom, left to right  

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,120
that we want the user to access our dashboard 
and read our dashboard. Some tips with this are  

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
to print out your dashboard before you get started 
and label all the pieces and the number that you  

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,840
want for the attributes. It's also a good idea 
to set the ID attributes in increments of 10  

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,120
because then when you go back and add something 
else to the dashboard it's easier to add  

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,880
a ID element for that new at that new piece 
that you added in between two numbers that  

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,040
have a range of 10 rather than having to 
renumber all of your IDs to fit that piece in.  

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,440
It's also helpful you can before you edit it in 
the text editor you can set names for different  

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,240
parts of your dashboard and that will make 
it easier to figure out what should get what ID.  

32
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,040
So this is an example of what it looks like 
in the XML, and you'll notice I have some names  

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,360
here, and I have my ID elements identified and 
renumbered. And you can see the different zone  

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,920
attributes that you get when you edit that XML 
file. So once our focus order is set correctly  

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,600
we can go through, and we've got the title then 
we've got the date we've got our filters, most  

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:38,080
recent day, past 10 days, and so on. And everything's 
happening in a logical order, in the correct order,  

37
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,760
and now when a user accesses this and is accessing 
it by tabbing they're going to get the right order  

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,400
and the top to bottom, left to right design 
that we want as they access the dashboard.

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,640
Some other considerations for designing accessible 
data visualizations. It's important to include  

40
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,520
descriptive titles, subtitles, and captions, and this 
is also important from a data literacy standpoint  

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,360
and making sure that our dashboards and data 
visualizations are understandable and clear  

42
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,920
to all users. Also thinking about using tools 
that have good screen reader compatibility  

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,440
and good compatibility with other accessibility 
web accessibility tools. Making sure we use alt  

44
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,680
text to describe images and logos and 
static pieces of a data visualization. Encoding  

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,160
data with sound as well as visuals. And making 
sure following the W3C accessibility guidelines  

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,760
for the web which makes sure that the web and all 
the parts of the web are accessible for all users.  

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:42,640
And here I've just quoted the focus order 
guideline 2.4.3 which makes sure that the web  

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,000
can be navigated sequentially by all users. I hope 
you found this talk useful. If you'd like to get  

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,720
in touch with me, my website and twitter handle are 
here. I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.
